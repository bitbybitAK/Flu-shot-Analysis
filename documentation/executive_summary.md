## Problem

Influenza vaccination remains a critical public health intervention, yet significant disparities exist in vaccination uptake across geographic regions and demographic groups. Despite national efforts to improve flu vaccination rates, substantial gaps persist that threaten public health outcomes and create inequitable access to preventive care. Understanding these disparities at the county level is essential for targeted interventions and resource allocation.

**Key Challenges:**
- Inconsistent vaccination coverage across counties (range: 14.4% - 58.5%)
- Persistent demographic disparities in vaccination uptake
- Limited visibility into county-level performance and trends
- Need for evidence-based interventions to address coverage gaps
