## Statistical Methodology

### Confidence Interval Calculation
- **Method:** 95% confidence intervals calculated from sample data
- **Formula:** CI = mean ± (1.96 × standard error)
- **Application:** All county-level and demographic estimates
- **Purpose:** Quantify statistical uncertainty in vaccination rate estimates

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Missing data handling:** Rows with missing key variables excluded (8.3%)
- **FIPS code validation:** 100% of counties have valid FIPS codes
- **Temporal consistency:** Multi-year validation for trend analysis
- **Geographic accuracy:** FIPS code verification against US Census data

### Aggregation Methods
- **County-level:** Mean vaccination rates across all dimensions
- **State-level:** Population-weighted averages of county rates
- **Demographic:** Stratified analysis by age, race/ethnicity, setting
- **Temporal:** Year-over-year trend analysis with confidence intervals

---

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Limitations
- **Sample size:** Varies by county and year (1-7 records per county-year)
- **Coverage gaps:** Some counties have limited data in recent years
- **Demographic detail:** Limited granularity in some demographic categories
- **Setting definitions:** May not capture all vaccination locations

### Methodological Considerations
- **Confidence intervals:** Wider for counties with fewer records
- **Trend analysis:** Limited by data availability in early years
- **Geographic analysis:** FIPS codes may not reflect current county boundaries
- **Demographic analysis:** Sample sizes vary across demographic groups

### Recommendations for Future Analysis
- **Enhanced data collection:** Increase sample sizes for better precision
- **Geographic updates:** Regular FIPS code validation and updates
- **Demographic expansion:** More detailed race/ethnicity categories
- **Temporal consistency:** Standardized data collection across all years
